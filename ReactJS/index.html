<!--
The assignment allows for practicing the ReactJS skills so far 
The high-level target is to create a movie renting app with the following requirement

1. Create an HTML page with the following sections 
     - Header with logo/name / navigation bar
     - Categories of movies
     - Footer

2. List of movies under each category where each movie can be looked at further by clicking on it
3. Detail page for the movie where more details about the movie could be seen, e.g. reviews, actors, etc.
4. All the pages should be created using reactjs components
5. These components should be able to re-render based on the change in state (e.g. list of movies change on the basis of the chosen category)
6. One component should be able to interact with the other (inherited/nested component) based on props passed to it

      Note: this page is a great way to try React but it's not suitable for production.
      It slowly compiles JSX with Babel in the browser and uses a large development build of React.

      Read this section for a production-ready setup with JSX:
      https://reactjs.org/docs/add-react-to-a-website.html#add-jsx-to-a-project

      In a larger project, you can use an integrated toolchain that includes JSX instead:
      https://reactjs.org/docs/create-a-new-react-app.html

      You can also use React without JSX, in which case you can remove Babel:
